On running the file, the program will ask for the name of the company or team. On answering, a HTML file will be written. The program will then ask for information about the user. When the users have answered all the questions about a given employee, their information will be added to the HTML file, and the program will prompt asking the user if there is another employee to add. When the user has added all the employees, the closing tags will be added to the HTML file, and the file will be able to be run.
